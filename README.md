# Loan-Repayment-Prediction
Using Machine learning to predict loan repayment - Lending Club

The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/jeandedieunyandwi/lending-club-dataset


LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform located in San Francisco, California, United States.

Our goal is to use dataset provided to build a model that predict wether or not the borrower will pay back the loan. 
The model can help assess new borrowers if they will be able to pay the loan based on their historical information.
